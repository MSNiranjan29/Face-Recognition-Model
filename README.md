# Face-Recognition-Model

Realtime Face Emotion Detector
This project aims to detect facial emotions in real-time using a webcam. The model processes video frames and identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

Requirements
To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The required Python packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Installing Dependencies
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/realtime-face-emotion-detector.git
cd realtime-face-emotion-detector
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Emotion Detector
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the emotion detector script:


python realtimedetection.py
This will start the webcam and display a window with the real-time emotion detection results.
